## Dataset

In our paper, we use the following datasets.

+ [D-NeRF](https://www.albertpumarola.com/research/D-NeRF/index.html): a synthetic monocular dataset which contains 8 scenes.
+ [HyperNeRF](https://hypernerf.github.io): a real-world dataset captured by one or two cameras.
+ [Neu3D](https://neural-3d-video.github.io/): a real-world dataset captured by multiple cameras with fixed poses.

We follow the experimental setting of [4D-GS](https://guanjunwu.github.io/4dgs/) for the real-world HyperNeRF and Neu3D dataset, and thank very much for their excellent work.
For the HyperNeRF dataset, we use the ```points.npy``` provided by the dataset to initialize the Gaussians, mainly following the [Deformable-3D-Gaussians](https://github.com/ingra14m/Deformable-3D-Gaussians).
For the Neu3D dataset, we use the ```points3D_downsample2.ply``` generated by ColMap used in the [4D-GS](https://guanjunwu.github.io/4dgs/) to initialize the Gaussians.

## Pipeline

## Install

```shell
git clone https://github.com/JiaweiXu8/Grid4D.git
cd Grid4D

conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate Grid4D

# require CUDA 11.X
pip install -e ./submodules/depth-diff-gaussian-rasterization
pip install -e ./submodules/simple-knn
```

## Run

### train

```shell
python train.py -s <scene path> -m <output path> --conf ./arguments/<dataset>/<scene>.py
```

### render

```shell
python render.py --conf ./arguments/<dataset>/<scene>.py -m <output path>
```
You can use the best checkpoint during the training process by adding ```--iteration best``` to get better results.

### evaluation

```shell
python metrics.py -m <output path>
```

This framework has been adapted from [Gaussian Splatting](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/), [Deformable-3D-Gaussians](https://github.com/ingra14m/Deformable-3D-Gaussians). The implementation of hash encoding is heavily based on [ObjectSDF++](https://github.com/QianyiWu/objectsdf_plus/tree/main). We sincerely appreciate the excellent works of these authors.
